	abstract = {Most textbooks on regression focus on theory and the simplest of examples. Real statistical problems, however, are complex and subtle. This is not a book about the theory of regression. It is about using regression to solve real problems of comparison, estimation, prediction, and causal inference. Unlike other books, it focuses on practical issues such as sample size and missing data and a wide range of goals and techniques. It jumps right in to methods and computer code you can use immediately. Real examples, real stories from the authors' experience demonstrate what regression can do and its limitations, with practical advice for understanding assumptions and implementing methods for experiments and observational studies. They make a smooth transition to logistic regression and {GLM}. The emphasis is on computation in R and Stan rather than derivations, with code available online. Graphics and presentation aid understanding of the models and model fitting},

	abstract = {{SARS}-{CoV}-2 variants of concern ({VOC}) are more transmissible and have the potential for increased disease severity and decreased vaccine effectiveness. We estimated the effectiveness of {BNT}162b2 (Pfizer-{BioNTech} Comirnaty), {mRNA}-1273 (Moderna Spikevax), and {ChAdOx}1 ({AstraZeneca} Vaxzevria) vaccines against symptomatic {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection and {COVID}-19 hospitalization or death caused by the Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), Gamma (P.1), and Delta (B.1.617.2) {VOCs} in Ontario, Canada using a test-negative design study. Effectiveness against symptomatic infection ≥7 days after two doses was 89–92\% against Alpha, 87\% against Beta, 88\% against Gamma, 82–89\% against Beta/Gamma, and 87–95\% against Delta across vaccine products. The corresponding estimates ≥14 days after one dose were lower. Effectiveness estimates against hospitalization or death were similar to, or higher than, against symptomatic infection. Effectiveness against symptomatic infection is generally lower for older adults (≥60 years) compared to younger adults ({\textless}60 years) for most of the {VOC}-vaccine combinations.},

The article also discusses considerations for setting the limits of a {ROPE} and emphasizes that analogous considerations apply to setting the decision thresholds for p values and Bayes factors.},
