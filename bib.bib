	abstract = {Most textbooks on regression focus on theory and the simplest of examples. Real statistical problems, however, are complex and subtle. This is not a book about the theory of regression. It is about using regression to solve real problems of comparison, estimation, prediction, and causal inference. Unlike other books, it focuses on practical issues such as sample size and missing data and a wide range of goals and techniques. It jumps right in to methods and computer code you can use immediately. Real examples, real stories from the authors' experience demonstrate what regression can do and its limitations, with practical advice for understanding assumptions and implementing methods for experiments and observational studies. They make a smooth transition to logistic regression and {GLM}. The emphasis is on computation in R and Stan rather than derivations, with code available online. Graphics and presentation aid understanding of the models and model fitting},

We estimated the effectiveness of {BNT}162b2 (Pfizer-{BioNTech} Comirnaty), {mRNA}-1273 (Moderna Spikevax), and {ChAdOx}1 ({AstraZeneca} Vaxzevria) vaccines against symptomatic {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection and {COVID}-19 hospitalization or death caused by the Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), Gamma (P.1), and Delta (B.1.617.2) {VOCs} in Ontario, Canada using a test-negative design study. Effectiveness against symptomatic infection ≥7 days after two doses was 89–92\% against Alpha, 87\% against Beta, 88\% against Gamma, 82–89\% against Beta/Gamma, and 87–95\% against Delta across vaccine products. The corresponding estimates ≥14 days after one dose were lower. Effectiveness estimates against hospitalization or death were similar to, or higher than, against symptomatic infection. Effectiveness against symptomatic infection is generally lower for older adults (≥60 years) compared to younger adults ({\textless}60 years) for most of the {VOC}-vaccine combinations.},

All relevant publications were systematically searched and collected from major databases up to 12 March 2021. A total of 25 {RCTs} (123 datasets), 58,889 cases that received the {COVID}-19 vaccine and 46,638 controls who received placebo were included in the meta-analysis. In total, {mRNA}-based and adenovirus-vectored {COVID}-19 vaccines had 94.6\% (95\% {CI} 0.936–0.954) and 80.2\% (95\% {CI} 0.56–0.93) efficacy in phase {II}/{III} {RCTs}, respectively. Efficacy of the adenovirus-vectored vaccine after the first (97.6\%; 95\% {CI} 0.939–0.997) and second (98.2\%; 95\% {CI} 0.980–0.984) doses was the highest against receptor-binding domain ({RBD}) antigen after 3 weeks of injections. The {mRNA}-based vaccines had the highest level of side effects reported except for diarrhea and arthralgia. Aluminum-adjuvanted vaccines had the lowest systemic and local side effects between vaccines’ adjuvant or without adjuvant, except for injection site redness. The adenovirus-vectored and {mRNA}-based vaccines for {COVID}-19 showed the highest efficacy after first and second doses, respectively. The {mRNA}-based vaccines had higher side effects. Remarkably few experienced extreme adverse effects and all stimulated robust immune responses.},

	abstract = {Enhancing vaccine uptake is a critical public health challenge1. Overcoming vaccine hesitancy2,3 and failure to follow through on vaccination intentions3 requires effective communication strategies3,4. Here we present two sequential randomized controlled trials to test the effect of behavioural interventions on the uptake of {COVID}-19 vaccines. We designed text-based reminders that make vaccination salient and easy, and delivered them to participants drawn from a healthcare system one day (first randomized controlled trial) (n = 93,354 participants; clinicaltrials number {NCT}04800965) and eight days (second randomized controlled trial) (n = 67,092 individuals; clinicaltrials number {NCT}04801524) after they received a notification of vaccine eligibility. The first reminder boosted appointment and vaccination rates within the healthcare system by 6.07 (84\%) and 3.57 (26\%) percentage points, respectively; the second reminder increased those outcomes by 1.65 and 1.06 percentage points, respectively. The first reminder had a greater effect when it was designed to make participants feel ownership of the vaccine dose. However, we found no evidence that combining the first reminder with a video-based information intervention designed to address vaccine hesitancy heightened its effect. We performed online studies (n = 3,181 participants) to examine vaccination intentions, which revealed patterns that diverged from those of the first randomized controlled trial; this underscores the importance of pilot-testing interventions in the field. Our findings inform the design of behavioural nudges for promoting health decisions5, and highlight the value of making vaccination easy and inducing feelings of ownership over vaccines.},
